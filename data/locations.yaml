  description: Nasi lemak is often considered the national food of Malaysia, and there are plenty of places to eat it throughout Kuala Lumpur. Having been around since 1948, Nasi Lemak Tanglin is a place I had wanted to go for a while. It was overall very good, with a nice laid back atmosphere and surrounded by nature.

  description: One of my favorite places to eat ikan bakar, grilled fish, is on Jalan Bellamy. Back in 2012, I had to hike over a highway and climb a few fences to get there as I was only on foot. In this video, I’m a bit older, and we had a car! The ikan bakar was just as good as I remember it.

Banana leaf south Indian food is very popular and I was recommended to try Sri Ganapathi Mess, a restaurant tucked away into a home. An amazing south Indian food experience in Kuala Lumpur.

  description: Without a doubt, one of the Malaysian foods you don’t want to miss when you visit Kelantan is nasi kerabu, rice salad, but it’s so much more than that. It’s a breakfast dish and we first started at Nasi Kerabu Panji, a local favorite spot. You get blue rice, topped with salad and side dishes, drizzled in budu fermented fish sauce, and topped with you choice of main mean. It was extraordinary.

  description: Since nasi kerabu is one of the top Malaysian foods of the state of Kelantan, we decided to have two nasi kerabu’s back to back, but totally different styles and even different colors of rice. Jijah's Nasi Kerabu specializes in grilled goat, and it was incredible, highly recommended when you visit Kelantan, Malaysia.

Laksam - 3.50 MYR ($0.86) per bowl - I had a bowl of laksam, a Kelantan Malaysian food version of laksa.

This restaurant was amazing, a huge mix of dishes, friendly owner, and delicious food. Of course, we couldn’t resist the tempoyak - fermented durian paste.

  description: One of the foods you have to eat in Melaka is Hainanese chicken rice balls. The rice is cooked with chicken broth like most chicken rice, but instead of just a plate of rice, you get little fish ball shaped rice balls, along with chicken. It’s an iconic dish, but it’s pretty delicious and makes a wonderful breakfast.

  description: Asam pedas is sour spicy, and you’ll find variations of it across much of Southeast Asia, but Melaka is quite famous for it within Malaysia. We went to Asam Pedas Pak Man, a stall set up within a local Malaysian food court. I ordered a variety of different plates, each asam pedas but with a different fish. All were spectacular. It looks extremely spicy, but it’s not actually all that spicy, however it is extremely tasty and full of herbs and chilies and flavor. Best Malaysian food dish of the day in Melaka for me.

There are quite a few huge seafood restaurants in Melaka, but I wanted one that was kind of small and laid back. Ikan Bakar Haji Masu was fantastic, and I think the best thing was their grilled fish.

  description: One of the most legendary Malaysian street food stalls in Kuala Lumpur is Annuar's Fish Head Curry, also known as the Bangsar fish head corner. Mr. Annuar is an amazing hard working man who has been selling his south Indian Muslim style fish head curry for a long time and has a loyal following. He’s also known for his affordable prices and his fried chicken. The staff were all incredible nice, and their fish head was amazing. I also especially loved the fried chicken with the fish head curry sauce on top. Mr. Annuar would not charge us for our meal, thank you!

They serve all sorts of Malaysian food, but their most famous dish is their Malay style fish head curry. We met the chef of the curry, and I just asked him to choose us the largest size which happened to be a 120 RM fish head! Most of the others were 45 - 65 RM! This was probably the best fish head curry for me of this entire Malaysian food fish head curry tour. The complexity of flavor and the ingredients blew me away.

They gave us not only the head, but really the entire body minus the tail. It was delicious, perfectly steamed with wonderfully fragrant ginger, and it was a perfect fish to end the meal with.
