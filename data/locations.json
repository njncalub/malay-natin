You get blue rice, topped with salad and side dishes, drizzled in budu fermented fish sauce, and topped with you choice of main mean. It was extraordinary.",

It looks extremely spicy, but it’s not actually all that spicy, however it is extremely tasty and full of herbs and chilies and flavor. Best Malaysian food dish of the day in Melaka for me.",

We met the chef of the curry, and I just asked him to choose us the largest size which happened to be a 120 RM fish head! Most of the others were 45 - 65 RM! This was probably the best fish head curry for me of this entire Malaysian food fish head curry tour. The complexity of flavor and the ingredients blew me away.",
