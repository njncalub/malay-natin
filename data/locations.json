You get blue rice, topped with salad and side dishes, drizzled in budu fermented fish sauce, and topped with you choice of main mean. It was extraordinary.",

We went to Asam Pedas Pak Man, a stall set up within a local Malaysian food court. I ordered a variety of different plates, each asam pedas but with a different fish. All were spectacular. It looks extremely spicy, but it’s not actually all that spicy, however it is extremely tasty and full of herbs and chilies and flavor. Best Malaysian food dish of the day in Melaka for me.",
